In this final project for Electricity and Magnetism, our team of 3 decided to see if we could model the electrodynamic coupling of magnets placed on the arms of two fidget spinners. Our team found prior work that contained equations describing our observed phenomenon, applied those equations to our specific problem, designed the experiment, created a model, and compared our model against our experimental results.

We used MATLAB to model our equations and to generate our graphs. The following video describes our experiment and gives an overview of our project.
