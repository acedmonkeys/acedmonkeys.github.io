For my Machine Learning final project, I created an introductory assignment to the topic of fairness in machine learning. This assignment provides some background and introduces a few notions and ongoing discussions about fairness in the computer science and machien learning communities.

You can find the full assignment <a class="normalfont" target="_blank" href="/imgs/ml_assignment.pdf">here</a>, and a poster summarizing the topics covered in the assignment along with the first five pages of the assignment are displayed in the images below.
