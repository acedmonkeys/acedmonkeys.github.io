The SoundCrystal music player was a semester-long project for Principles of Engineering. Our team of 5 was tasked with designing and fabricating an original, fully-integrated system with non-trivial mechanical, electrical, and software components over three 2-week sprint cycles, all with a team budget of $250.

Our goal was to make an interactive, reactive musical experience. Once a marble "coin" is inserted into a marble run, a user is asked to select a song from a fixed list (stored on a Raspberry Pi) using the LED interface. The music player will then the motion of a prop record needle and CD, and begin playing the song, flashing its LEDs in time to the music. In an alternate mode, you can connect the SoundCrystal to a computer and play any song from that, and the SoundCrystal will work as a speaker system with lights that flash to the song.

Below are two videos showing the SoundCrystal in action.
