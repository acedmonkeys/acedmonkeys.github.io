My first project at Olin and the first project for Design Nature. This class emphasized drawing inspiration from nature. We were tasked with creating a hopping mechanism by studying the hopping bugs and insects we saw in the field (or in the woods behind our school). Our final hopper would have to use a similar hopping mechanism to a creature in nature, as well as have some sort of delay mechanism so that it would not hop immediately upon release. I based my hopper off of the springtail, and used a wound-up fishing line as my trigger which double as the antennae of a springtail in my final design.

Some of my field sketches and final hopping toy can be seen in the images above. A demo of my hopping toy can be seen in the video below.
