<h1 class="lightfont"> About Me </h1>
<p>I am currently a senior at Olin College of Engineering, where I am a student of Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering. These pursuits combined result in my self-designed major (B.S. in Engineering with Concentration in Mathematics). Through coursework, internships, extracurriculars, and outside hobbies and activities, I have developed skills in:</p>

    <td>3D-Printing<br>Laser Cutting<br>Arduino<br>Miling and Turning<br><sup>(Manual, Conversational)</sup></td>

    <td>Python<br>Java<br>MATLAB<br>Git<br>Processing</td>
    <td>Microsoft Office Suite<br>LaTeX<br>HTML/CSS</td>
  </tr>

<p> Most of these skills were picked up in some engineering capacity. The skills I have gained from studying mathematics require a more literary description: creative problem solving, logical reasoning and organization, making connections, synthesizing the "big picture" or underlying patterns and structures, and a habit of breaking up intimidating problems into smaller, more digestable pieces. Some of these skills are on display in my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>.
<p> I have interned as a Mechanical Design Engineer at the Aberdeen Test Center in Maryland, and worked as a Program Instructor at the DaVinci Challenge Camp hosted by the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China. </p>
<p> In my free time, I enjoy reading and drawing. </p>
