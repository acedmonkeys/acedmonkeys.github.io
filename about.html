<p>I am currently a senior at Olin College of Engineering, where I am a student of Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering. These pursuits combined result in my self-designed major (B.S. in Engineering with Concentration in Mathematics). Through my engineering coursework, internships, extracurriculars, hobbies, and interests, I have developed skills in:</p>
<table class="oohbaby">
  <tr>
    <th> Mechanical Design </th>
    <th> Prototyping</th>
    <th> Visuals </th>
    <th> Software </th>
    <th> Documentation </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DFM/DFA Analysis<br>FEA<br>CAD<br><sup>(Solidworks, Fusion 360)</sup></td>
    <td>3D-Printing<br>Laser Cutting<br>Arduino<br>Miling and Turning<br><sup>(Manual, Conversational)</sup></td>
    <td>Adobe Photoshop<br>Adobe Illustrator<br>Adobe InDesign</td>
    <td>Python<br>Java<br>MATLAB<br>Git<br>Processing</td>
    <td>Microsoft Office Suite<br>LaTeX<br>HTML/CSS</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> Somewhat ironically, most of what I've gained through studying mathematics is less well-defined, and fits rather poorly into a table. This includes:
  <ul>
    <li> how to construct an argument clearly and logically with well-defined statements</li>
    <li> patience with problems and the importance of tackling problems from different angles</li>
    <li> confidence in navigating heavy mathematical notation and formulas</li>
    <li> an appreciation for patterns, connections, and underlying structures in ideas</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>It would also be disingenuous to include some of the less tangible things I've learned through the team projects I've been a part of during my time at Olin:
  <ul>
    <li> how to communicate within a team: conveying ideas, listening to others, arranging meetings, resolving conflicts</li>
    <li> the importance of maintaining a healthy team atmosphere, morale, and team work ethic </li>
    <li> the importance of working with your stakeholders and balancing values and priorities </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p> Some of these skills are on display in my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>.</p>
<p> My previous work experience includes an internship as a Mechanical Design Engineer at the Aberdeen Test Center in Maryland, and work as a Program Instructor at the DaVinci Challenge Camp hosted by the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China. </p>
<p> In my free time, I enjoy reading, drawing, going on walks with my dog, or otherwise learning something new.</p>
