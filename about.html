  <p>I am currently a senior at Olin College of Engineering, where I am a student of Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering. These pursuits combined result in my self-designed major (B.S. in Engineering with Concentration in Mathematics).</p>
  <p> Through my engineering coursework, internships, extracurriculars, hobbies, and interests, I have developed skills in:</p>
  <table class="oohbaby">
    <tr>
      <th> Mechanical Design </th>
      <th> Prototyping</th>
      <th> Visuals </th>
      <th> Software </th>
      <th> Documentation </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>DFM/DFA Analysis<br>FEA<br>CAD<br><sup>(Solidworks, Fusion 360)</sup><br>CAM<br><sup>(Fusion 360)</sup></td>
      <td>3D-Printing<br>Laser Cutting<br>Arduino<br>Miling and Turning<br><sup>(Manual, Conversational)</sup></td>
      <td>Adobe Photoshop<br>Adobe Illustrator<br>Adobe InDesign</td>
      <td>Python<br>Java<br>MATLAB<br>Git<br>Processing</td>
      <td>Microsoft Office Suite<br>LaTeX<br>HTML/CSS</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p> Somewhat ironically, most of what I've gained through studying mathematics is less well-defined, and fits rather poorly into a table. This includes:
    <ul>
      <li> how to construct an argument clearly and logically with well-defined statements</li>
      <li> patience with problems and the importance of tackling problems from different angles</li>
      <li> confidence in navigating heavy mathematical notation and formulas</li>
      <li> an appreciation for patterns, connections, and underlying structures in ideas</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Being a member on multiple team projects at Olin has also taught me the following:
    <ul>
      <li> how to communicate within a team: conveying ideas, listening to others, arranging meetings, resolving conflicts</li>
      <li> the importance of maintaining a healthy team atmosphere, morale, and work ethic </li>
      <li> the importance of working with your stakeholders and balancing values and priorities </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p> Various combinations and amalgamations of the aforementioned skills are on display in my <a href="portfolio.html"><span class="normalfont">portfolio</span></a>.</p>
  <p> My previous work experience includes an internship as a Mechanical Design Engineer at the Aberdeen Test Center in Maryland, and work as a Program Instructor at the DaVinci Challenge Camp hosted by the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China. </p>
  <p> In my free time, I enjoy reading, drawing, exploring with my dog, and learning new things.</p>
