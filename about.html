<p> Some of these skills are on display in my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>.
<p> I have interned as a Mechanical Design Engineer at the Aberdeen Test Center in Maryland, and worked as a Program Instructor at the DaVinci Challenge Camp hosted by the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China. </p>
<p> In my free time, I enjoy reading and drawing. </p>

<h2 class="lightfont"> About the Website </h2>
<p>Let's set the scene: it's winter break, between the final two semesters of my undergraduate education. It also happens to be 2019, and world is abuzz with phrases like "a decade in review" and "personal reflection". Post-undergrad plans need to be solidified.
