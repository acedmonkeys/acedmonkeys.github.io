It's the 6th day of the year, so there are 360 days after this one until the next year. This is a rather arbitrary designation: who cares whether there are 360 or 361 days left, or whether or not we are 6 days rather than 5 days into the year we've collectively decided to call "2020"? It is one of those special years that's a full day longer than the majority of other years, too, but what's another 24 hours, give or take?

Anyhow, 360 is a rather nice number. It's factorization is 2<sup>3</sup> x 3<sup>2</sup> x 5<sup>1</sup>, giving it some aesthetic appeal: it's made up of 3 multiples of the first prime number, 2 of the second, and 1 of the third. Moreover, it's the number of degrees in a full rotation, giving the impression that it's a round sort of number-- circular in quality, without edges. Friendly, benign (that's how I feel about circles, anyway). At midnight tonight, we'll be 1/60th of the way into the year: repeat these last 6 days 60 times and the year will be over.
