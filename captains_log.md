<h3>Crystallize - <span class = "lightfont"> Tokyo Shoegazer </span></h3>
<p>
Bright, in particular, is the song that opened the world of shoegaze music to me. But it's a beautifully constructed album, and it has felt like such a long time since I listened to an album that was put together in that way. The songs are a part of each other and belong to each other, but are also individually worlds unto themselves.

<h3>Hinamatsuri - <span class = "lightfont"> Otake Masao </span></h3>
<p>
one of the funniest manga i've read, easily. ok maybe the funniest. belly laughs
</p>

<h3>stereochrome - <span class = "lightfont"> She Her Her Hers </span></h3>
<p>
I can't stop listening to this album. they really know how to start a song. The thought that comes to mind: it sounds like the way deep breaths feel in your chest!
</p>

<h3>Like Grains of Sand (1995) - <span class = "lightfont"> Ryosuke Hashaguchi </span></h3>
<p>
What a gorgeous, tender movie. The same sort of tenderness I feel when Lorde sings about a girl stroking her cheek, like people are gossamer, that their souls should be gently held. The central trio are completely compelling: Ito, Yoshida, Aihara. The supporting cast and characters are all important, without taking away from the gravity of the central three.

<h3>The Fallen Crimson - <span class = "lightfont"> envy </span></h3>
It's very strange that I feel like I am learning how to enjoy things again. Stunning. A faint new world into Rhythm is the violence of noise, followed by a contrast showing how soothing and sweet it can be. There's something primal and alive about the music, while maintaining melodic lines that glow and feel golden. The music crests and it feels like the sun breaking through the clouds, a turning point with joy, something bitter, something free.

<h3>The Story of A Brief Marriage - <span class = "lightfont"> Anuk Arudpragasm</span></h3>
<p>
I went online and read some reviews after I finished this one, and there was an anecdotal consensus that it had taken a surprisingly long time to read, despite not being such a long book. It's true, it's heavy reading. The paragraphs are dense and contemplative, and the subject matter is uncomfortable, as much as carving the fragility and strength of life at its core, which are also its contours, into your consciousness is uncomfortable. Being alive means shitting, it means pissing, it means breathing. It is drinking water and eating food and clinging to one another. The human core, the ability to care for another, to not be alone, to hope. Exists no miracle mightier than this: to feel. Somehow, despite the death, suspended and released grief, we see that even the most rudimentary actions and experiences are worthy of marvel. It's the hushed awe and horror of being a living thing with consciousness, grasping among other living things for one another.

<h3>Lot - <span class = "lightfont"> Bryan Washington </span></h3>
<p>
These stories make me feel like a series of exclamation marks as I move through them. ! . !!. !!!!!!. !!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! even within one sentence, there's barely time for breath (which means there is, but its gasps).
