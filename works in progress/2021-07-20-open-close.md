I keep opening my inbox, opening twitter, closing, opening, refreshing.
Am I waiting for something to happen?
Everything is already happening, all at once.
I don't even read most of the emails.
No pause between the waves, just endless churn.
It is too much to process, all the noises at once, until it all becomes one homogenous mass
No pauses, the pauses give distinction, I require the blur.
